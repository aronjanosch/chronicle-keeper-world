//! First-launch onboarding seed.
//!
//! On a brand-new database the library is empty, which gives a new user nothing

//! carries a sample transcript *and* a sample AI summary — so the whole pipeline
//! is visible before the user records anything.
//!
//! It seeds exactly once, tracked by the `example_seeded` config flag. The flag
//! is deliberately *not* part of [`crate::config::default_config`] so reading
//! config never sets it. Once seeded the flag stays set forever, so deleting the
//! example never makes it reappear — the user owns it from then on.

The elected head of [[Cinderhold]], a soft-handed merchant out of his depth. He hired the party to find out why the warding stones along the rim have gone cold.

He is hiding how little coin the town actually has left — [[Vesh]] caught the lie in session one.

const SAMPLE_TRANSCRIPT: &str = r#"[The Keeper]
We open in Cinderhold, in the back room of the Last Lantern. Mayor Oren has a map spread on the table and keeps smoothing it flat even though it's already flat.
"Three of the rim stones went cold this month. Three. My grandfather's whole life, none went cold. I'll pay what I can — please, just go up and look."

[Brannik Stonebellow (Sam)]
I take out the tuning hammer and set it on the table where he can see it.
"If they're dead, this'll tell us which ones. Stone doesn't lie."

[Vesh (Priya)]
While he's talking I'm watching his hands. Is he lying about the coin? I want an Insight check.
That's a nineteen.

[The Keeper]
He's not lying about wanting your help. But he is lying about how much he can pay — the town is nearly broke.

[Sister Calla (Leo)]
I put a hand on the map. "We'll go. But if the Compact is failing, gold is the least of anyone's problems."

[The Keeper]
The three of you climb the rim road at dawn. The first dead stone is cracked clean through, and the ash around it is warm to the touch.

const SAMPLE_SUMMARY: &str = r#"# Session 1: The Cold Stones

## Recap
The Ashfall Compact gathered in Cinderhold at the request of **Mayor Teller Oren**, who is frightened by three of the rim's warding stones going cold in a single month. The party agreed to investigate the failing wards, and on the climb up the rim road found the first dead stone cracked through — with warm ash gathering around its base.

## Key beats
- **Mayor Oren's plea.** Three rim stones have gone cold this month, unheard of in living memory. He begged the party to investigate.
- **Reading the mayor.** Vesh caught that Oren is sincere about needing help but is hiding how little coin Cinderhold has left — the town is nearly broke.
- **A grim warning.** Sister Calla reframed the job: if the Compact itself is failing, money is the smallest of everyone's worries.
- **The first dead stone.** At dawn the party reached a cracked, cold warding stone; the surrounding ash was warm — a sign the fire below is stirring.

## NPCs
- **Mayor Teller Oren** — anxious, broke, sincere. Wants the wards fixed, can't really pay for it.

## Loot & tools
- **Brannik's tuning hammer** proved its worth: it rings near a live ward-stone and falls silent near a dead one — the party's tool for mapping which stones have failed.

## Threads for next time
- Map the remaining rim stones with the hammer — how many are already cold?
- Why is the ash *warm* around a dead stone?
- Find the **Ember Wardens** — they remember the original Compact and may know why it's unraveling.
